# Shoely-Deep-Learning-Based-Shoe-Recommender
## Motivation
"A picture is worth a thousand words", you might have heard this idiom and we might not agree that one needs exactly 1000 words to describe an image but I can assure you that a picture of a shoe contains more information that I can convey with twenty something shoe-describing words that I know. That number is probably different for different groups of people and most likely I'll be in a cluster surronded by PhDs who didn't have time to look up shoes online. The fact that we cannot describe all the information in, most if not all, pictures using words only is not surprising as our languages are not as evolved as our vision and words were actualy used to communicate observations in the physical world or hallucinations.
Shoely utilizes the power of images to help shoppers find the shoes that they like at the best price. It learns about a person's style and is able to recommend new shoes based on prevoius likes/dislikes or even by looking through your photos. Shoely can although be incorporated into an image-based style recommender that can help, as an example, finding the shoes that look good with other apparel.
